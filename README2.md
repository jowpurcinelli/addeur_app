Addeur_App
</h1>
Private project for a China-based startup striving for reducing truck's emissions, so we wish to have an app that enables truckers to find their cargo quickly and efficiently executing 'empty cargo'. Therefore, all APIs are from Chinese suppliers such as Huawei, Alibaba, and Tencent.

## Addeur App
The app was created using Expo CLI.
To download all dependencies locally, run `yarn` in the terminal on the project main folder.

Once you've installed all dependencies, it will be ready to go.

To run the project follow the instructions below.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />


The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!



### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments.
